Digital timing refers to the precise measurement and control of time in electronic systems using digital signals. Unlike analog timing, which relies on continuous signals, digital timing operates through discrete intervals, typically measured in pulses or clock cycles. Digital timing is critical in synchronizing operations within processors, managing data transmission speeds, controlling sequential logic circuits, and ensuring tasks occur at exact intervals. It is widely used in digital clocks, timers, computers, and communication systems, providing reliability and accuracy essential for complex digital devices.
